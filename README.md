Quick review on what had happened in last few weeks
1. Start COURSERA course, https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning
2. Search Internet, prepare a to-learn list
3. Search resource on Internet
4. Boughts some books on Amazon, mainly on mathmatic. Schaum: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics. 
5. Local meet up: April 22, Estimate Galaxy Distance from Sloan Digital Sky Survey using ML

7. Keep exploring the unknown unknown, keep learning the known unkonwn

The fact about the local meet up:
