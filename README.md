# Journey
Machine learning journey. 

## Background
AI have reached an important milestone: 
* Jan 28, 2016 - AlphaGo goes into public: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html
* March 15, 2016 - AlphaGo 4:1 Lee Sedol

## Getting Started
* March 28, 2016 - Start first course on COURSERA, Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
* April 25, 2016 - First update

## April 25, 2016
Quick review on what had happened in last few weeks

1. Start COURSERA courses, https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning
2. Search Internet, prepare a to-learn list
3. Search resource on Internet
4. Boughts some books on Amazon, mainly on mathmatic. Schaum: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics. 
5. Local meet up: April 22, Estimate Galaxy Distance from Sloan Digital Sky Survey using ML
6. Looking for resource and support within company
7. Keep exploring the unknown unknown, keep learning the known unkonwn

The fact about the local meet up:

1. 40 people show up, more than half are CEO/CTO. Female less than 15%
2. show case is based on Regression. About 5 people had raised meaningful questions. 

## May 2, 2016
* Explore spider, anti-spider and anti anti-spider. 
* Find a couple of interesting scenarios. 
 
## May 8, 2016
* Finish first MOOC course: Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
* Wrap up, Revisit all the ipython notebook from that course. 
* Explore other specialization

## May 31, 2016
* Start Python for Data Analysis: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
* Assigned a key project role, 200+ issues on my back now. Have to leave for a while

## May 11, 2017
* Project go live, happy ending! 6 months crazy project + 2 month hyper care + holiday + other staff, finally I am back!  
* Finsh [Numerical and Scientific Computing with SciPy](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/video/big-data-and-business-intelligence/9781786469427), Spend a week to create note and clean the code. 
* Start [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml). Amazon start selling this [Book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491962291/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) at middle April, worth your 28 bucks. Compare to early release version, it comes with better format. 

## July 20, 2017
* Finished book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml), haven't run the code especially part II. 
* Start Coursera: [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
* Start Pandas: [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
* Prepared Machine Learning Overview slides, share knowledge to 4 groups within company
* Invite world class AI expert to give speech in company
* Join company workshop , by Google Research's Philip Nelson and Patrick Riley
* Clean local meet up pictures and share to team. 6 in 3 months
* Start coaching a workmates on machine learning

## Aug 2, 2017
* 10+ local meet up in the bay area in recent. Really fun but I have to say some of them are not make sense. 
* Get lots of fun on reading and coding, but I have to drop for 6-8 weeks. Will back at end of Sept. 

## Aug 7, 2017
*  Academic and industry lead don't suggest me follow that plan ... So I am back. Will continue my current learning path and more focus on the core skills. 

## Aug 8, 2017
* Plan a more structure way of learning. 
* Andrew NG just announced a new deep learning specialization courses. 3 out of 5 already released, interesting. 
* Joined a local meetup, Aldo Carrascoso is pretty good, like his speech. 

## Aug 9, 2017
* Need learn python. Also stats, such as Chi-squared distribution. But let me finish this course, deep learning specialization, rest of the courses in this specialization, and then think about Python and stats (ops, priority sounds like an excuse)

# Lesson learn
* Focus on your core skills. 
* Practice, practice, practice. 
* Listen and Learn from others
* It is a journey that never ends. Keep swimming.
